    <p>This homemade pancake recipe has been a beloved staple in my kitchen since my kids were little, and for good reason. Made with ingredients I always have hand—like flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, milk, eggs, and butter—the pancakes have the perfect texture: fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside</p>
    <h2>Ingridient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegtable oil</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps on how to make pancake</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix well</li>
        <li>Combine the eggs and milk in a bowl</li>
        <li>Whisk to combine</li>
        <li>Pour the milk mixture and the melted butter into the dry ingredients</li>
        <li>Stir just enough to moisten the flour mixture. It should look a little lumpy. (If you overwork the mixture, the pancakes will be tough.) This is a thick batter but if it seems too thick, add a bit more milk</li>
        <li>Whisk in a bowl of pancake batter</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or large nonstick pan over medium heat; coat it lightly with vegetable oil and swirl in a thin pat of butter. Ladle the batter onto the skillet, using about ¼ cup for each pancake; cook until the first side is golden brown, or until the top surface bubbles and is dotted with holes</li>
        <li>Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown. This happens quickly so peek after 30 seconds and watch carefully! Adjust the heat setting if necessary.</li>
        <li>Wipe the griddle totally clean with a paper towel between batches. Serve immediately with maple syrup and a pat of butter, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
